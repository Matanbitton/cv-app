## About The Project

This project is a CV builder that enables users to create and export a resume in PDF format that is made to look aesthetic and professional, within minutes.

it is completely free.

The idea for this project came to mind after searching online for a free and easy to use CV builder.
I didn't like that ones Canva offered for free.
So I decided to create on myself with the help of **[react-to-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-pdf)** npm package.

## What I learned:

- How to use framer motion for animations.

- How to use useState to manage forms data.

## What I struggled with:

- To think about the best way to design the UI.

- To find a way to export the resume as PDF and keep the CSS styling.

## What I enjoyed:

- The ease of use of Framer Motion.

- The result of the resume PDF that turned out beautifully in my opinion.

## Future Improvements:

- Create a backend with firebase that allow users to log in and save their data.

- Refractor the PDFfile.js file becasue it is wayy too long and it's because of problems I experienced with react-to-pdf.

## Known issues:

- If at least 3 of the form catagories remain blank Chrome prints an absurd number of pages something like 31,771 that is a known bug in Chrome which happens when using the CSS gap attribute.
